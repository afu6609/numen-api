/**
 * A channel-less {@link Connection} for a companion fake {@code ServerPlayer}.
 * The server pushes a steady stream of clientbound packets at any list-resident
 * player (position, chunks, entity updates, keep-alives); a real connection
 * writes them to a netty channel, but our companion has no client on the other
 * end. A bare {@code new Connection(...)} is NOT safe: its {@code send} queues
 * every packet into an unbounded {@code pendingActions} list when no channel is
 * attached — a slow leak. So we subclass and DISCARD all outbound I/O.
 *
 * <p>{@code Connection} is non-final with a public {@code PacketFlow} ctor, so
 * this is pure common code — no reflection, access-wideners or mixins. Two
 * details make {@code placeNewPlayer} accept it:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>SERVERBOUND</b> receiving flow — a server-side player connection
 *       receives serverbound packets, so its listener is serverbound;
 *       {@code validateListener} rejects a CLIENTBOUND mismatch.</li>
 *   <li>a real (in-memory) {@link EmbeddedChannel} — registering this Connection
 *       as the embedded channel's handler fires {@code channelActive}, setting
 *       {@code this.channel} so {@code placeNewPlayer} has a channel to work on.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Outbound packets are still discarded by the {@code send} override (the embedded
 * channel is never written to, so it never buffers/leaks), and the keep-alive
 * timeout is neutralised via the no-op {@code disconnect}. Lifecycle is governed
 * by {@code CompanionLifecycle}, not by connection state.
 *
 * <p>1.20.1 predates the configuration phase, so {@code setListener} does no
 * channel-protocol validation — the bare embedded channel is enough (no protocol
 * attribute seeding needed, unlike 1.20.4+).
